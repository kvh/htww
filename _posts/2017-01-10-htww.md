<h1 class="page-title">How the World Works</h1>

Below are 10 books that will teach you **how the world *actually* works.**

The first 12 (or 16) years of your education focused on memorizing "facts": passphrases that you
handed back to your teacher at exam time, with varying success. After you left the formal education
system, you learned about the world through articles and front-page news: stories -- interesting
stories -- that usually had little connection with the underlying truth.

Which is to say you might have gone the first 20, 30, 80 years of your life not really learning how
the world *actually* works. I did. To understand how the world works requires building a model of
the fundamental forces and causes that drive events and behaviors. It requires zooming out of time
and place to see the bigger patterns and forces. The world is chaotic and random, but a surprising
amount becomes predictable when you have the right mental models of the world.

That's what the [ten books below](#the-list) attempt to give you -- the right frameworks for interpreting and
predicting the world around you.

If they live up to their promise, and you actually make it through all of them, they will give you a
superpower: it will feel like the cover has been lifted off the world and its moving parts have been
exposed -- all the mechanics of people and society now plain for you to see. This is the power of
the condensed knowledge of hundreds of years of thought and research contained in these books. It's
like cheating. If you can call 8,000 plus pages of dense reading cheating.


The books have been selected with preference for the following criteria:

 - **Fundamental** - They approach a discipline from a systems perspective, focus on the most
important aspects of a discipline, and distill it to the fundamental forces. They don't worry about
being opinionated, biased, or not comprehensive -- they just want to get to the bottom of things.
The readings expose the underlying *causal* mechanics, not narrow observations or experiments strung
together.

 - **Readable** - The books are engaging to the curious mind, are well written, and respect the
 reader's time and attention.

 - **History-first** - They focus on a comparative history of the important events that *actually
happened* and their interpretation, as opposed to focusing on a theory and then supporting it with
history. Why? There's a selection problem: it's too easy to find history (or science) that fits to
any given theory, so we end up with the most seductive theories being the most popular and widely
accepted. A history-first approach asks: What are the big events and unknowns that need to be
explained and what is the best explanation given the facts of the situation? This question makes us
less susceptible to seductive theories and allows our minds to build their own causal models of the
world. Theory-first books are incentivized to present an over-simplified world-view. This is not to
say there is no theory in these books -- any serious work is a mixture of both theory
and facts -- but that there is a bias towards facts over theory, where possible, or where there is
significant doubt about the theory.

This is *not* a "Greatest books of all time" list; there are factors that are specifically NOT
considered for this list:

- **Influential** - This list isn't for celebrating past literary or scientific achievements, it's
for teaching us how the world works. Books that were revolutionary and ground-breaking in their day
are often superseded at some point by a new synthesis of modern thinking (or are already
incorporated into our world-view), and so are not a good fit for this list. (Sorry Darwin!)

- **Gripping** - Lots of great non-fiction books are great because of the depth and color they bring
to a particular story: a biography, a subject matter, a journey. Sometimes these stories have deep
and broad implications on how the world works (see [book #9](#9-the-power-broker)), but often they
are just captivating in their narrow way. Most of the books on this list *are* actually fascinating,
but by consequence and accident of the primary criteria, not by selection.

- **Moral** - Other great books teach us how we *should* act -- they emphasize moral lessons or
great triumphs or violations of justice. These books are important and rightly deserve the
recognition they get, but this list is for the what, how, and why; not the should or shouldn't.


## The List

The books do not necessarily have to be read in order: Parts 1 and 2, for example, can be read
mostly independently. Also, the books within a part often reinforce (or contradict) each other on
the same subject matters, so reading them back-to-back could be repetitive, whereas interleaving
them would keep things fresh and improve retention. Each book is also accompanied by two other
recommendations: a "pre-read" -- generally a lighter introduction to the subject; and a "follow-on"
-- a chance to go deeper on a particular subject or read another perspective.

This list isn't definitive -- it isn't the only such list you could create -- and there are
certainly great books I've missed ([suggestions welcome](https://github.com/kvh/htww)) and even
greater books that have yet to be written. But I hope it succeeds in its aims nonetheless: to give
you the superpower of knowing how the world works.

# Part 1: History

We start with four "big history" books covering the whole sweep of humanity and its creations. These
books will give us a foundation for interpreting our modern world. The perspectives of history are
fascinating in how they illuminate our own world.


## 1. [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062316095/)

![Sapiens](images/sapiens.jpg)

Sapiens is a big history of the human species, from our evolution in Africa millions of years ago,
through the cultural, agricultural, and scientific revolutions. It's an unvarnished look at the
human condition on the grandest scale. It introduces us to a recurring theme: the world is
fundamentally evolutionary (“Darwinian”) – those organisms, empires, cultures, organizations, and
ideas that survive and/or “reproduce” successfully are the ones that will tend to exist in the
world. As in: religion spread not because of its righteousness or the will of a higher power, but
because groups of humans that happened to adopt religion cooperated better than those that did not,
and were therefore more successful at reproducing and expanding.

**Pre-read**: [Non-zero](https://www.amazon.com/Nonzero-Logic-Destiny-Robert-Wright/dp/0679758941/) -
A shorter, more optimistic zoom through human evolutionary history, with an emphasis on the trend of
increasing cooperation at increasingly large scales.

**Follow-on**: [Guns, Germs, and Steel](https://www.amazon.com/Guns-Germs-Steel-Fates-Societies-ebook/dp/B000VDUWMC/) -
If you still haven't had enough grand early human history you can check out the similar,
also very popular (but flawed) Guns, Germs, and Steel.


## 2. [The Origins of Political Order](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007XFOK3I/)


![Origins](images/origins.jpg)

Origins of Political Order is another big history book, covering political development and the
formation of states from the earliest civilizations up to the industrial revolution. Fukuyama's
sweeping knowledge of comparative history makes for a highly credible journey through the basic
realities of state building and what it means to have a functioning government and how you arrive
there. Few history books achieve so much in so few pages.

**Pre-read**: No pre-read, just read Fukuyama. Both volumes ideally.

**Follow-on**: [Political Order and Political Decay](https://www.amazon.com/Political-Order-Decay-Industrial-Globalization-ebook/dp/B00IQOFS7M/) -
The second volume in the series. Similar
topic, but covering political development from the industrial revolution up to modern times. Highly
recommended.


## 3. [The Worldly Philosophers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/068486214X/)

![philosophers](images/philosophers.jpg)

Heilbroner gives us a tour of the history of economic thought, through the lives of the great minds
that developed it. Along the way we learn the fundamentals of economics and its historical
development, as well as about economic philosophy's (large, occasionally catastrophic) role in
shaping our world. Infinitely better than the remedial calculus course you were given as economics
101.

**Pre-read**: [Economics in One Lesson](https://mises.org/system/tdf/Henry%20Hazlitt%20Economics%20in%20One%20Lesson.pdf?file=1&type=document) -
[PDF] Quick primer (less than 200 pages!) on basic economics if you've never taken a course, or forgot the one you did
take. Mind the libertarian slant.

**Follow-on**: [The Road to Serfdom](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0226320618/) -
A bit more Hayek to balance out Heilbroner.


## 4. [The Birth of Plenty](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071747044/)

![plenty](images/plenty.jpg)

For most of human civilization economics was boring: almost all production was agricultural, growth
was driven by the Malthusian population cycle, and entrepreneurship and innovation were limited. The
industrial revolution and rise of modern liberal capitalism have changed that and transformed our
world. Now direct economic forces drive nearly everything in our daily lives. This is why we are
reading a second book on economics.

The Birth of Plenty gives a history of modern economic development, describing the conditions under
which economic growth and prosperity occur. It rehashes some of the ground covered (more seriously)
by Fukuyama in Origins of Political Order, feel free to skim those sections. But it captures the
critical elements of what makes a capitalistic system function.

**Pre-read**: [Basic Economics: A Citizen's Guide to the Economy](https://www.amazon.com/Basic-Economics-Thomas-Sowell/dp/0465060730/) -
Another, alternative, intro to economics, also with a strong libertarian slant.

**Follow-on**: [Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty](https://www.amazon.com/Why-Nations-Fail-Origins-Prosperity/dp/0307719227/) -
Another comparative look at economic development.

---

# Part 2: People

We all have an intuitive understanding of ourselves, the people in our lives, and the social
interactions that are so important to our world. Nonetheless, we carry blindspots (often by design)
to some of the basic aspects of our behavior. These books illuminate the more hidden elements of
people and their behaviors, as well as providing a foundation for thinking about the source and
motivation of behaviors in general.


## 5. [Sociobiology](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674002350/)

![sociobiology](images/sociobiology.jpg)

Sociobiology provides the foundation for understanding animal, and thus human, behavior as social
organisms, covering the biological and evolutionary origins of altruism, cooperation, aggression,
sex, and everything in between.

**Pre-read**: [Selfish Gene](https://www.amazon.com/Selfish-Gene-Anniversary-Landmark-Science-ebook/dp/B01GI5F2FS/) -
The classic evolutionist's text.

**Follow-on**: [On Human Nature](https://www.amazon.com/Human-Nature-Edward-O-Wilson-ebook/dp/B00AQLFQKW/) -
O.E. Wilson's next book, going deeper on the implications for
human behavior.


## 6. [The Social Animal](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1429233419/)

![animal](images/animal.jpg)

Psychology is plagued by bad science and popular writing misinterpreting it. There are a lot of
over-reaching extrapolations and over-confident generalizations of narrow, contrived experiments on
college students. This isn't because researchers are "doing it wrong" (although some are), but
because the science is *inherently hard*: you can only control one variable in an experiment, but
social and psychological contexts involve hundreds of complex dimensions, dozens of which can be
important to the outcome. To make it worse, both context and outcomes are often not directly
observable, but can only be measured in proxy. Bottom line, it is hard to experimentally verify
human behavior.

With that giant caveat, I present one of the best on offer: The Social Animal is a
compendium of social psychology research, covering our behaviors under social conditions, including
all our quirks and dysfunctions. Fascinating reading.

**Pre-read**: [Influence](https://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Robert-Cialdini/dp/006124189X/) -
A lighter, more targeted introduction to similar concepts.

**Follow-on**: [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman-ebook/dp/B00555X8OA/) -
This is an impressive cataloging of psychology and behavioral economics research. All the same
caveats from above apply here as well.


## 7. [The World’s Religions](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061660183/)

![religions](images/religions.jpg)

For most of human civilization, religion was (and still is, to various extents) the foundation of
society, culture, rule of law, and even economic production. The World's Religions is a dive into
each of the world's seven main religions -- Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Islam,
Judaism, and Christianity -- plus consideration of primal religions.  What you get from this text
(and which parts you can skip) will depend on your own religious background. Smith is an engaging,
if not particularly critical, narrator.

**Pre-read**: [Social and Cultural Anthropology: A Very Short Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/Social-Cultural-Anthropology-Short-Introduction/dp/0192853465/) - Quick, readable overview.

**Follow-on**: [The Varieties of Religious Experience](https://www.amazon.com/Varieties-Religious-Experience-Study-Nature-ebook/dp/B00MAJYHDU/) -
Old classic, religion from the perspective
of a psychologist.


---

# Part 3: Organizations

Organizations are the foundation for the basic functions of society -- businesses, municipalities,
civic groups, churches, etc. They are the day-to-day institutions that operate the world. We'll
study the two most important here: Political and business organizations.


## 8. [Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400077303/)

![titan](images/titan.jpg)

Titan is the story of the life of John D. Rockefeller and the rise of Standard Oil. It's also the
story of entrepreneurship, industry, and business -- and the fundamental forces at work in
capitalism.

**Pre-read**: [Business Adventures](https://www.amazon.com/Business-Adventures-Twelve-Classic-Street-ebook/dp/B00L1TPCKW/) -
There's a reason Bill Gates and Warren Buffet recommend this book -- it's because it is the epitome
of a *history-first* book: no grand seductive theory, just real stories that illuminate interesting
aspects of how the world works.

**Follow-on**: [Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060536357/) -
A highly entertaining introduction to the world of finance and corporate management.


## 9. [The Power Broker](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0394720245/)

![power](images/power.jpg)

This biography of New York public servant Robert Moses is a case study in power and politics -- how
an individual can accumulate power and resources politically, and the true dynamics of political
systems. One of the best biographies ever written.

**Pre-read**: [The Dictator's Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Dictators-Handbook-Behavior-Almost-Politics-ebook/dp/B005GPSLHI/) -
Presents a coherent theory of power and how to keep it.

**Follow-on**: No follow on, the 1,300+ dense pages of The Power Broker is enough!


## 10. [The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439110123/)

![prize](images/prize.jpg)

A recounting of the 20th century through the lens of oil, which is a very illuminating lens. It
shows us the interaction of state and business, and how the dynamics of power and money play out on
a grand scale. Yergin does not find much to fault with the oil industry or capitalism in general, it
is mostly an uncritical account, so make sure to keep your own perspective.

**Pre-read**: [Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder, and One Man’s Fight for Justice](https://www.amazon.com/Red-Notice-Finance-Murder-Justice-ebook/dp/B00LD1ORX6/) -
Not really a pre-read. Another perspective on power and money, operating in a different environment.
An absolute page turner.

**Follow-on**: [Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World](https://www.amazon.com/Lords-Finance-Bankers-Broke-World-ebook/dp/B001QIGZEK/) -
Deep into the world of finance and international politics -- not much has changed in the intervening
90 years.
